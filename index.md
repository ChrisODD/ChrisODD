        		<h1>My First Website in CIST 1510</h1>
				<p>Hi there, I'm Christopher Swiger. I live in the state of Georgia. We moved to the state right before the pandemic happened and it wasn't a good start for being in the United States for the first time in a while. I came from a military family from Germany and I spent most of my school years there while I spent the rest in Georgia.</p>
			<p>Since I've had experience with coding in the past, I am assuming python to be at least mentioned. The last time I used python was when I was modifying the coding of a file from a game. As for github, I've never used it for coding but I do go in those websites that includes github in the url to download a file I would need for a specific application to work. I am hoping to learn more about how website coding in github works. </p>
